# My website

# To do:
- [ ] Make the website responsive for mobile (For some resolutions is already responsive)
- [ ] Fix the background (it shouldn't move when you scroll the page)
- [ ] Generically improve the website (speed, animations, loadings...)

## YouTube playlist page

I Think the contrast between the technological future (main page) and the old good past (YT playlist page) is quite good, but maybe is better to chose only one "theme" (future/past)
